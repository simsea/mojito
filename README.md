mojito
======

Mojito is an project that full encapsulates an Entity/Component model with 
Processor support to keep data separated from implementation as well as providing
run-time extension of object properties.

For reference, please see [the Entity Component System Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). 
Mojito is an effort to make a practical implementation of that system to allow for
a more dynamic system. Originally written to drive the Sheepdog project, it is useful for
other projects moving forward.

Documentation can be generated using doxygen on the mojito.doxy script.
